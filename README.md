A simple script for common nmap scanning
=============

=============

Be aware to have installed nmap library for python. The program uses the most basic flags for nmap
#-PR for host discovery

#-sT -p- for all TCP ports

#-sT -F for the TCP fast

#-sU -p- for all UDP

#-sT -sU -F for TCP and UDP

Remember that UDP scans will take a lot of time due UDP protocol's nature

This is a simple project just for fun, if you find it useful let me know, or contact me for any question
